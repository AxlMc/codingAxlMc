This compilation of files is a combination of research and my own knowledge in Javascript.  

I used this week to completely learn something new.  I have never dealt with APIs, node.js framework, express.  Through hours of training I found a way to use the GIPHY API to search for items.  Sadly, I was not able to impliment some of the other requirements for this assignment.  If I were to do this again, I would try implimenting a database such as MongoDB to store the customer rating and comment data; though I did not quite have enough time to learn how to do that this time.
